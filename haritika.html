    <p><i><h4>Haritaki - a gift from Mother Earth, packed with the essence of holistic healing. It is one of Triphala's three magic ingredients, along with Amalaki and Bhibakti
        . Haritaki in Ayurveda is known for its healing and rejuvenating properties. It has antibacterial, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant properties. 
        The name Haritaki is sometimes interpreted as the “embodiment of lord Hari”, one of the three Hindu gods responsible for the upkeep of the world. In Buddhism too it is referred
         to as the Big Golden Fruit. Due to its cleansing and restorative abilities, many people believe it to provide spiritual balance.  
        Ayurveda believes that the body is comprised of three doshas namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. When haritaki is taken in appropriate quantities, it has the power to balance all three doshas. 
        This quality makes it one of the most versatile herbs of Ayurveda. To pacify the air element or Vata dosha it is consumed with ghee or clarified butter. To pacify the Pitta dosha or fire element
         it is taken with sugar and to pacify the Kapha dosha or water and earth element it is consumed with rock salt. Using different herbal combinations for different dosha treatments is the key concept in 
        Ayurveda. Our body is
         made up of five elements (Water, Earth, Air, Fire, and Ether) and they can be harmonized by making certain dietary and lifestyle modifications..</h4></i>
