    <p><i><h4>Shatavari is an Ayurvedic rasayana herb which is also known as the female-friendly herb. It is helpful in menstrual disorders and acts as a uterine tonic. It enhances breast development and increases breast milk production by regulating hormonal balance.
        Shatavari is also beneficial for men as it improves testosterone levels. It might be good for diabetics as it helps manage blood sugar levels. Shatavari might also promote memory functions due to its antioxidant activity.
        According to Ayurveda, Shatavari boosts immunity due to its Rasayana (rejuvenating) property and helps in weight gain due to its Balya property.
        Shatavari powder can be taken along with milk or honey twice a day to get relief from the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
        Applying Shatavari powder paste along with milk or honey on the skin helps to get rid of wrinkles. It can also help promote wound healing when applied along with coconut oil.
        People with weak digestion are advised to avoid taking Shatavari as it is Guru (heavy) in nature and might take time to get digested[2-6]..</h4></i>
