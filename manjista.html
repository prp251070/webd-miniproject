    <p><i><h4>Manjistha or Indian Madder is considered to be one of the best blood-purifying herbs. It is mainly used to break down blockages in the blood flow and remove stagnant blood.
        Manjistha herb can be used both internally and externally on skin for promoting skin whitening. Applying Manjistha powder along with honey or rose water (at least 2-3 times a week) helps manage acne and pimples by inhibiting the growth of acne-causing bacteria due to its antioxidant property. Topical application of Manjistha oil and coconut oil reduces inflammation and skin rashes associated with acne due to its anti-inflammatory property. It is also helpful in keeping the hair shiny and healthy. Rinsing your eyes with Manjistha decoction might help control excessive watery discharge due to its astringent property.
        As per Ayurveda, taking Manjistha powder after lunch and dinner helps manage diarrhea due to its Deepan (appetizer) and Pachan (digestive) properties. Consuming Manjistha on a regular basis might be good for diabetics as it lowers the blood glucose levels.
        Excessive consumption of Manjistha might cause constipation due to its Guru and Kashaya properties. So, It is advisable to take Manjistha with hot water, if you already have any digestion-related problem
