    <p><i><h4>Amla is generally known as an Indian Gooseberry. The berries of the trees are potently used for medicinal formulations due to
         their healing properties. Amla tree contains small berries that are round and yellowish-green in colour. Due to its several health benefits, 
         it should be referred to as a superfood.
         In ancient Ayurveda, the Amla is known by a different name such as sour, nurse, immortality, and mother.

        One unique taste characteristic of Amla is full of five different tastes like pungent,
         astringent, sweet, bitter, sour, and other than this; it helps in keeping better health of mind and body.
          This is the reason it is known as a divine medicine ”Divyaushada.” Amla in Sanskrit is known as Amalaki, which means nectar of life. In
           this blog we will learn about Amla benefits, uses of Amla and more on Amla or Nellikai in English</h4></i>
